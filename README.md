# **Hi there 👋 🤩** 

Thanks for checking out my profile! I'm Rohan Matharu, with 21 years of coding experience starting from when I was 6, inspired by my dad coding in Visual Basic and using Microsoft Access in the early 2000s. These tools laid my foundation in coding, starting with basic constructs like if statements and for loops, and quickly advancing to recursion and object-oriented programming by age 10. My journey in coding has been driven by a curiosity to create something from nothing. I've explored numerous operating systems, built CPUs, and learned crucial lessons from my successes and mistakes in both hardware and software. With over a decade in customer service, my communication skills and language flexibility are assets I bring to any team.

I hope this gives you a glimpse into who I am.
